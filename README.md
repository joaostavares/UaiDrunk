### Complete repository of the project made for FETIN

The execution instructions for each part of the project can be found in their directories within this repository.

Note that these codes only contain the tested part that was presented in full during the fair, there is a considerable portion of code that was considered by me to be poorly optimized or in need of refactoring, which was therefore excluded from this code compilation.

Also be aware that the instructions are very summarized (not to say incomplete) and are only for those who know what they are doing, the project was just a proof of concept, the code has little or no refinement, and so little can be considered "stable", it just works as intended
